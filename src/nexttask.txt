- Add drop screen
- Add inspection screen?
- Should really add tests for sprintfing oneliners
- Refactor screens to reuse code
- Have weights line up on menu screens
- Overflowing or dropping items stacks them on the floor
- Bring up a menu screen when > 1 item on floor tile?
- item stacking???? (I think that should be later)
