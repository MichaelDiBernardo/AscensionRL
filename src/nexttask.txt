- When switching 2H weapons, send overflow to floor.
- What happens when floor stack is full? When you drop or when your hands overflow?
- Right now getting seems to be broken when inventory is full (message isn't displaying anymore)
- There should be some message when you walk over a stack / floor item.
- HUD
- Add inspection screen?
- Have weights line up on menu screens
